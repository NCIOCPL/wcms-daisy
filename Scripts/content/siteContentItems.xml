    <bodyfield><![CDATA[A metabolic phenotype represents the collection of all metabolites within a biological system and it reflects the influence of both genetic and lifestyle factors. Metabolomics is a field of research that studies metabolic phenotypes by characterizing large numbers (e.g. 800+) of small molecules within biofluids, such as plasma or urine. This goal of this study is to use metabolomics techniques to identify specific metabolites or metabolic profiles that can be used as biomarkers for lifestyle-related exposures or as prospective markers for cancer risk.]]></bodyfield>

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[I am conducting a screening cohort study of 1,000 HIV-positive MSM participating in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) health maintenance program. Under written, informed consent, participating KPNC members will respond to a self-administered risk factor questionnaire and will undergo two anal specimen collections into liquid-based cytology (LBC) medium prior to a digital exam and high resolution anoscopy. Subjects will be followed annually for two years to collect follow-up clinical data related to outcomes. Baseline clinician-collected specimens will be tested in a masked fashion for the following clinical biomarkers: 1) carcinogenic HPV DNA in aggregate and individual carcinogenic HPV genotypes; 2) carcinogenic HPV RNA and HPV16/18 RNA; 3) cytogenetic changes (3q, 5p, and 20q amplification); and 4) p16INK4a and Ki-67 immunocytochemical staining. For reference, clinician-collected specimens will be used to make LBC slides and evaluated by an expert cytopathology laboratory. We will estimate the HPV genotype-specific risk and the clinical performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and referral rates) of individual tests and combinations of tests for detection of prevalently-detected, one-year cumulative, and two-year cumulative histologically-confirmed anal precancer (anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3) or worse (=AIN3). All MSM will undergo diagnostic procedures at all visits and independent of testing results, which will result in unbiased disease ascertainment.]]></bodyfield>

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[his is a population-based multidisciplinary case-control study that was conducted in Shanghai, China, from 1997 to 2002, to investigate the risk factors for biliary tract cancer. The study enrolled over 3,000 persons, including 643 case subjects with cancer (382 gallbladder, 192 bile duct, and 68 ampulla of Vater), 1,037 control subjects with gallstones and bile duct stones, and 959 healthy subjects randomly selected from the population. Potential risk factors evaluated included a history of gallstones, bacterial infection of the biliary tract, diabetes, cholecystitis, diet, use of tobacco and/or alcohol, obesity, reproductive factors, and a family history of cancer. In addition to an in-person interview, blood and urine samples were collected from cases and controls. Bile samples, gallstones, and tissue were collected from cases and gallstone controls for biochemical, molecular, and microbiologic analyses. More information, Ann Hsing]]></bodyfield>

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[Osteosarcoma, which is the most common primary bone tumor, occurs most frequently in adolescents, but there is also a second incidence peak among individuals aged > 60 years. Most osteosarcoma epidemiology studies have been embedded in large analyses of bone tumors in general, all histologic subtypes combined, or focused on cases occurring in adolescence. Detailed descriptions of osteosarcoma incidence and survival in particular, with direct comparisons among patients of all ages and ethnicities, are not available. We have completed and published several analyses of US (SEER) and international cancer registry data, to more fully characterize the descriptive epidemiology of osteogenic sarcoma.

Frequency, incidence, and survival rates for 3,482 patients with osteosarcoma from the National Cancer Institute's population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program diagnosed between 1973 and 2004 were investigated by age, race, sex, pathology subtype, stage, and anatomic site. There were large differences in incidence and survival rates by age. There was a high percentage of osteosarcoma with Paget disease and osteosarcoma as a second or later cancer among the elderly. Tumor site differences among age groups were noted. Survival rates varied by anatomic site and disease stage, and did not improve significantly from 1984 to 2004. In this comprehensive, population-based description of osteosarcoma, we identified important differences in incidence, survival, pathologic subtype, and anatomic site among age groups, and quantified the impact of osteosarcoma in patients with Paget disease or as a second cancer on incidence and mortality rates. These findings may have implications in understanding osteosarcoma biology and epidemiology.

Osteosarcoma incidence rates in the United States peak in adolescence and in the elderly. The international patterns of osteosarcoma incidence in children have been described, whereas those for young, middle age or elderly adults have not. Using the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents, International Agency for Cancer Research database we compared incidence rates for children and adolescents (age 0-24 years), the middle age group (25-59 years) and elderly (> or = 60 years) persons by world regions and individual countries. Overall, worldwide osteosarcoma incidence rates were quite similar in the younger age groups. The greatest variation in incidence rates was observed in the elderly.

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[We have a major interest aimed at identifying genetic modifiers of OS risk, building upon pilot observations made by Dr. Savage in the Bone Disease and Injury Study of Osteosarcoma. Analysis of 11 growth-related genes identified a functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in IGF2R that was associated with an odds ratio = 2.0. Selected TP53 SNPs were associated with 6- to 8-fold increases in OS risk, and a reduced risk (i.e., a protective effect) was observed for specific haplotypes in the telomere genes TERF1, POT1 and TEP1. A collaboration has been established with the Children's Oncology Group to extend these observations into a larger series of OS cases and controls.

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[A collaboration has been established with the US Children's Oncology Group (COG), the NCI-sponsored clinical trials cooperative group that treats the vast majority of children diagnosed with cancer in this country. We have initiated a study of germline genetic variation and OS risk, using 900 OS cases from which COG has collected and stored germline DNA samples. Controls will be selected from prior and ongoing DCEG studies, genetically matched to avoid bias related to population stratification. This study has evolved from one in which htSNPS from a ~100 biologically-plausible candidate genes (including those identified in our earlier work) implicated in growth, height, hormone synthesis and metabolism, bone formation, tumor suppression, cell cycle regulation, chromosome stability, telomere maintenance, DNA repair and ribosomal metabolism would be genotyped, into a full-scale genomewide association study (see below).

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[The retrospective, candidate gene association study now underway in collaboration with the COG has grown and matured into an international genomewide association study (GWAS). In part, this has been facilitated by rapid decreases in the per subject costs for large-scale genotyping, and the increasing sophistication of genotyping platforms, which now include more than 1,000,000 SNPs and a similar number of copy number variants (CNVs). The COG samples comprise the cornerstone of a large, international effort, led by the NCI, which will undertake a genome-wide association study of OS. Identifying international investigators willing to contribute their OS-related samples and data will be critical to assembling the very large number of samples required to identify and validate candidate SNPs using a GWAS strategy. This process has begun.

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[As part of a prospective case-control study of OS initiated in 1995 between the NCI and Harvard Dental School (the Bone Disease and Injury Study of Osteosarcoma; BDISO), we have studied genetic variation in many genes potentially important in growth pathways. We identified a small haplotype block that was associated with two-fold increase in risk of OS in the IGF2R gene. This region (around exon 16) consisted of CpG islands, and functional analysis of the SNPs in this block suggested that a SNP associated with OS risk results in differential methylation at that SNP site.

Although most cases of OS are sporadic, it is also a prototypic syndrome-related malignancy in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome; germ-line TP53 mutations are the primary genetic basis for this rare disorder. Therefore, we investigated the role of germ-line genetic variation in TP53 as risk factors for sporadic OS. Although our data did not indicate a strong link between variation in TP53 and OS risk, they did provide preliminary evidence suggesting an increased risk of OS associated with TP53 variants IVS2+38 and Pro72Arg. While this was a small study, genetic variation across the TP53 gene was thoroughly investigated. Genetic variants in telomere maintenance genes are the focus of ongoing analysis. Preliminary data suggest a possible protective effect associated with specific variants in several different telomere pathway genes.

A formal meta-analysis of this plus other published osteogenic sarcoma case-control studies is now underway, under the leadership of CGB investigators. It will focus on a pooled analysis of birth weight, birth length and height as OS risk factors.

As a follow-up to these pilot observations, subjects from the BDISO OS case-control study were genotyped as part of DCEG's Rare Cancer iSelect project. Comprehensive analysis of more than 25,000 variants in several hundred carcinogenesis-related candidate genes and pathways is being conducted. Increased statistical power will be achieved through pooling of control subjects obtained from other DCEG studies, after careful correction for population stratification. Analysis of these data is currently underway.

Participants are drawn from the cross-sectional Biomarkers for Breast Cancer Prevention (B4BCP) study, which was designed to explore determinants of mammographic density in a sample of postmenopausal women. Participants were recruited when they sought mammographic evaluations at a radiology clinic near Buffalo, NY in 2005. They included 225 enrolled participants who were aged 45-80, postmenopausal, and reported no history of cancer or current hormone use. They provided first morning urine samples, and completed questionnaires which queried reproductive and medical histories, as well as dietary and lifestyle factors. The present study takes advantage of a well-characterized study sample, an intermediate marker of breast cancer risk, and the sensitive, specific, and reliable LC/MS2 assay to test hypotheses about the roles of estrogen metabolism in breast cancer etiology. Investigators are studying associations of urinary estrogen metabolite profiles with mammographic density, dietary and lifestyle factors, and established breast cancer risk factors.]]></bodyfield>

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[Motivated by the natural history of MMTV infection in mice and the null results of MMTV testing in women with breast cancer, in FY2006 the Branch conducted a pilot study of peripheral blood mononuclear cell phenotypes in 20 early stage women with breast cancer and 20 matched controls. Increased levels of regulatory T cells (CD4 CD25) were found in the cases. This is being pursued with a more specific marker (Fox-P3) and in a larger group of early stage breast cancer cases and controls, which will be analyzed in FY2007. If regulatory T cells in peripheral blood are higher in breast cancer cases than in controls, IIB will seek to use pre-diagnostic specimens from incident breast cancer cases and controls in the PLCO cohort, with expected completion in FY2008. If successful, the project area would be broadened, starting with previously collected case-control specimens, to other malignancies and to measures of innate immunity.

The main goal of this study is to evaluate susceptibility factors for breast cancer risk and their interactions with environmental risk factors. Enrollment and data collection started in June 1998 and was completed in April 2001. The CBCS obtained risk factor information from cases of invasive and in-situ breast cancer and from population controls through a telephone interview. At the end of the telephone interview, women were invited to participate in the buccal cell component of the study. Approximately 82 percent of eligible breast cancer cases and 78 percent of eligible controls agreed to participate in the study interview. A total of 7,833 subjects, representing approximately 75 percent of cases and 70 percent of controls that completed the interview, provided a cytobrush or mouthwash buccal cell sample. The main research projects being conducted include identification of genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer, including evaluation of gene-gene interactions, and in combination with other risk factor information to evaluate gene-environment interactions. We are also collecting mortality information from breast cancer cases in the study using the National Death Index to evaluate determinants of survival.]]></bodyfield>

A total of 7,224 women living in and around Columbia, MO who were free of cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer, donated blood to the serum bank on one or more occasions between 1977 and 1987. Approximately 25% of the women were premenopausal. At the time of each blood collection, interview information was obtained from participants on the major known breast cancer risk factors including age, height, weight, reproductive and menstrual histories, family history of breast cancer, medical conditions, and drug use, including oral contraceptives and menopausal hormone therapy. Date of last menstrual period was obtained for women who were premenopausal at the time of each blood collection. Approximately 30% of the women donated multiple samples over the first 10 years of the study, including 20% who had 3 or more samples, with collections occurring on average one year apart. In 1989, the first follow-up ascertained 107 breast cancers among women who were cancer-free at blood collection. A subset of these breast cancers was included in a number of biomarker studies, including the measurement of sex steroid hormones, carotenoids, alpha-tocopherol, selenium, organochlorine pesticides and PCBs. A more recent follow-up was completed in 2002, at which time an additional 279 breast cancers were identified.]]></bodyfield>

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[The etiology of male breast cancer has been difficult to clarify, given its relative rarity. Most previous studies have been of case-control designs, raising questions about the influence of recall biases. The identification of risk factors through prospective analyses is needed, although it is difficult to assemble sufficient numbers of cases in any individual study. A consortial approach is therefore underway, in which data from a number of studies will be pooled to derive sufficient power to fully explore the role of a variety of potential risk factors. Cohorts with biologic material collected prior to disease onset will be especially valuable for clarifying biologic mechanisms underlying identified risk factors. Of specific interest, given our current knowledge of male breast cancers, is the assessment of endogenous hormones and genetic markers. Questionnaire data and biologic samples (sera, DNA) are being sought for contribution to this consortial effort. This study is a valuable resource for adding to our knowledge of the etiology of male breast cancers.]]></bodyfield>

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[Invasive breast cancers are believed to arise from normal breast structures specifically, the potential milk secreting units called terminal duct lobular units (TDLU). The last decade of breast cancer research has resulted in several established breast cancer risk factors, yet the biological mechanisms and markers associated with these risk factors remain poorly defined. We hypothesize that altered histomorphology in TDLUs, levels of proliferation, levels of apoptosis, and levels of the ER and PR in TDLUs, may be associated with known breast cancer risk factors. Previous efforts to characterize mechanisms of carcinogenesis for known risk factors have been limited by small sample sizes and incomplete epidemiologic characterization of the subjects. We are collaborating with the Susan G. Komen® for the Cure Tissue Bank at the IU Simon Cancer Center (KTB), which offers a rich and unique opportunity for identifying links between biologic markers and breast cancer risk factors. This repository includes questionnaire data, breast tissue, saliva, serum, and whole blood collected from over 1000 healthy women volunteers that exhibited no evidence of breast cancer. The current project offers the possibility of determining the mechanisms by which risk factors act on epithelial cells prior to tumor development.]]></bodyfield>

This large population-based study combines state-of-the art techniques of exposure assessment and collection of biological specimens to allow for the study of a wide range of biomarkers. Exposure information is obtained through detailed personal interviews, anthropometric measurements, physical activity monitors, and collection of dust samples from the participants’ homes. The collection of biological specimens includes blood samples processed as cryopreserved whole blood, serum+ blood clot, plasma+buffy coat+red blood cells; 12-hour overnight urine; paraffin embedded tumor and normal tissue; and fresh tissue from tumors, non-neoplastic breast tissue and mammary fat tissue. We obtained five year follow-up information from medical records for approximately 1,300 breast cancer cases recruited in Warsaw and 300 cases recruited in Lodz, as well as mortality data on most cases in the study using the Cancer Registry and Death Certificate Office database in Poland. The main research projects being conducted include: Analyses of questionnaire-based factors and anthropometric/physical activity measurements in relation to cancer risk and clinical outcomes; identifying genetic susceptibility markers of cancer risk and clinical outcomes using candidate gene and genome-wide association (GWAS) approaches; analyses of breast tissue/tumor markers to evaluate relationships with cancer risk factors (known or suspected), and their impact on predicting recurrence and survival after diagnosis; and analyses of biomarkers in DNA (somatic changes), cryopreserved blood cells, serum/plasma, and urine in relationship to cancer risk and clinical outcomes.]]></bodyfield>

A total of 466 women ages 40-65 years who were clinically referred to radiologically-guided breast biopsy were enrolled from Fall 2007 through Summer 2010. The BREAST Stamp Project aims to characterize the radiologic, histologic, molecular, and biochemical features of dense breast tissue and to understand how the microenvironment of dense breasts promotes neoplastic transformation of the breast epithelium. Risk factor data and biological specimens (blood, buccal cells, tissue fluids, and tissue) required to discover mechanisms and biomarkers that link high mammographic density (as measured quantitatively using computerized methods) to breast cancer risk were collected from study participants.]]></bodyfield>

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[To improve the risk classification characterized by molecular markers, large population-based epidemiologic studies with strong pathology components are needed. A large population-based breast cancer case-control study conducted in Poland, including 2,386 incident cases and 2,502 randomly selected controls, provides an ideal resource. In collaboration with the Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch, DCEG, we have constructed tissue microarrays (TMAs) of invasive breast tumors and non-invasive tissues (ductal carcinoma in situ and normal terminal ductal lobular units) collected for the Polish study, and stained these TMAs for molecular markers. The goals of this study include:

To identify etiologically heterogeneous subsets of breast tumors by examining the expression and co-expression patterns of molecular markers involved in important pathways for breast carcinogenesis.
To compare marker expression in invasive tumors and non-invasive tissues for a better understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in tumor progression. 
To identify new markers for novel molecular classification of breast tumors into etiologically distinct subtypes using an integrated approach of tumor profiling (mRNA expression, gene copy number, microRNA, and methylation changes).

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[Mammographic breast density, the radiological representation of the fibroglandular composition of the breast, is one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that changes in breast density are related to changes in breast cancer risk. Ultrasound tomography (UST) is a novel radiological method that provides a three-dimensional image of the breast (as opposed to mammography which is two-dimensional). Our collaborators at Karmanos Cancer Institute have developed a UST device which allows the calculation of sound speed, an objective physical measurement which is positively correlated with breast density. Thus, UST offers the possibility of determining breast density serially over time as a volume, without compression of the breast or exposure to potentially harmful ionizing radiation. In collaboration with researchers at Karmanos Cancer Institute and the University of Toronto, HREB investigators will use UST to define the time course of volumetric breast density changes among women receiving tamoxifen treatment. Tamoxifen is known to reduce breast density and breast cancer risk. Over three years, we will enroll 150 women receiving tamoxifen monotherapy for atypical lobular or ductal hyperplasia, lobular or ductal carcinoma in situ, or invasive breast cancer at Karmanos Cancer Institute to undergo repeated volumetric breast density assessment with UST. We will assess whether UST examinations performed as early as 1-3 months following initiation of tamoxifen can identify women whose breast density is demonstrated to have declined at one year using mammography. For comparison, we will enroll 150 age-, race-, and menopausal status-matched women without breast cancer to assess changes in UST density over time without tamoxifen exposure. Risk factor data and blood will also be collected from study participants. The broader study objective is to assess the concept of breast density as a biosensor of tamoxifen response and UST as a useful tool for making this determination.]]></bodyfield>

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[This project is a study of the clinical management of low-grade cervical cytologic abnormalities. The major hypothesis to be tested is whether HPV testing can reliably triage the common cytologic diagnoses of ASCUS (Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) and LSIL (Low-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesions), which represent the bulk of cervical abnormalities seen on Pap smears. Currently, the most aggressive standard of care is immediate colposcopy and biopsy of all suspected lesions. This type of aggressive management is expensive with some associated morbidity, and probably represents over-treatment, since evidence indicates that most cases of ASCUS and LSIL eventually regress. This clinical trial of management alternatives consists of three arms: immediate colposcopic referral of all patients; triage using HPV testing as an adjunct to cytology; and conservative management with repeat Pap smears. All participants are being followed every 6 months for two years. Over 5,000 women were randomized during enrollment that ended in December, 1998. The baseline data showed that HPV DNA testing is a viable strategy for clarifying ASCUS cytology. However, HPV DNA prevalence in cases of LSIL proved too uniformly high to permit use of HPV DNA testing for triage.]]></bodyfield>

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[We now know that human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the necessary but not sufficient cause of cervical cancer. Cervical pathogenesis evolves as follows: normal cervical tissue, to oncogenic HPV infection, to precancer and then to invasive cancer. The majority of women with oncogenic HPV infections will not develop cancer, and most HPV infections, even those with associated cellular changes, regress in 1-2 years, probably eradicated or controlled by cellular immune response. Moreover, while invasive cancer and precancer are histologically well-defined, the histological classification of low-grade lesions, now better defined as HPV infection, is very heterogeneous and poorly reproducible. Identifying women at highest risk for cancer prior to neoplastic progression is therefore a challenge. At present, we are unable to predict with any accuracy which HPV infections will progress and which are among the majority that regress. It is therefore of etiologic interest and of public health benefit to develop a method for identifying the HPV-infected women at risk for progressing to precancer and invasion. To develop an accurate and reproducible division of precursor lesions (HPV infection and precancer) will require gaining knowledge about the molecular distinctions at each progressive disease state. Our goal is to therefore comprehensively assess biomarkers of risk for progressive cervical neoplasia, and thus develop a new set of biomarkers that can distinguish those at highest risk of cervical cancer from those with benign infection. Specifically, we will initially implement a cross-sectional study to develop a comprehensive list of potential risk biomarkers by examining cervical tissues of 2000 women with HPV infection, precancer, and cancer. We will measure gene expression profiles to gain an accurate and comprehensive in vivo picture of cervical neoplasia carcinogenesis. We propose to then validate the most promising identified candidate biomarkers in a prospective design by assessing their predictive values for key outcomes related to progression (HPV persistence, diagnosis of precancer) or non-progression (HPV clearance).]]></bodyfield>

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[A new NCI-funded, collaborative study on colposcopic biopsy is conducted at the University of Oklahoma, as part of an already established project on cervical cancer risk-marker discovery. The aims of the study are to study cervical disease on the lesion level, to optimize criteria for biopsy placement, and to analyze the incremental benefit of taking multiple biopsies. The study is conducted in close collaboration with the ASCCP represented by a colposcopy and pathology expert group. Following a standardized protocol for biopsy placement based on decreasing order of lesion severity as judged by colposcopic impression, up to 4 biopsies, including one randomly taken, will be performed on 1000 women referred to colposcopy. ECC will be restricted to women 30 and older. Colposcopic impression, acetowhitening, and biopsy placement will be documented using a digital imaging system. All biopsies taken from a woman will be analyzed separately using conventional histology, HPV typing, and biomarkers. We will study the topographic distribution and functional relation of multiple lesions on the cervix using HPV genotyping and biomarkers for viral transformation. The incremental benefit of taking additional targeted and random biopsies will be calculated. We will study the predictive value of candidate biomarkers against an improved gold standard. The results of the study will impact colposcopy and cervical cancer screening procedures in general. Making colposcopy more effective is important in a time of extensive screening (smaller lesions are detected) and vaccination against HPV (leading to an overall reduction of high grade lesions).]]></bodyfield>

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[Traditional cytology-based screening programs for cervical cancer prevention have failed everywhere other than resource-abundant settings. In resource constrained settings, while tests such as visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) provide a suitable platform for clinical evaluation and are very cheap, they are highly rater-dependent and suffer from substantial false positivity. Carcinogenic HPV DNA detection [e.g., HPV DNA testing by Hybrid Capture-2 (hc2) assay] is less specific than cytology and cannot differentiate between the great majority of benign infections and the few persistent infections linked to cervical pre-cancer. A reliable and robust test that improves both the sensitivity and specificity of screening may provide better alternatives for HIV-infected women than conventional cytology screening or VIA. This study [funded through the NIH Office of AIDS Research (OAR) ‘Intramural-to-India’ initiative] will be conducted in collaboration with the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI), a permanent institute of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in Pune, India. A cohort of 1000 HIV-infected women will undergo evaluation using two novel and potentially sustainable, lower-cost tests for accurate screening for cervical cancer. These tests include detection of HPV E6 oncoprotein (using a low-cost, rapid, strip test that detects HPV E6 oncoprotein and can be performed without complex machinery or a cold chain) and immunocytochemical staining using p16INK4a/Ki-67 (a biomarker correlated with the oncogenic transformation of cervical cells following persistent carcinogenic HPV infection). This study involves simultaneous and independent evaluation of these novel biomarkers along with confirmation by colposcopy/histopathology for all participants. Linear Array HPV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay will measure carcinogenic HPV-DNA for comparison purposes. This observational study will permit us to describe the sensitivity and specificity of any of the tests or combinations with reasonable precision for a wide range of prevalence of cervical pre-cancer and cancer. This study will allow evaluation of the field adoption and efficacy of these newer assays as well as permit validation of collection, transport, storage, and evaluation protocols.]]></bodyfield>

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[Currently, there are no convincing early detection approaches for endometrial and ovarian cancers. Although it is well established that some endometrial and ovarian tumors shed cytologically recognizable cells in routinely prepared Pap tests, it is clear that this approach rarely detects occult tumors. Accordingly, efforts to develop means of collecting biological samples that have high patient acceptability, good sensitivity for detecting early disease, and excellent specificity are needed. In this project, we want to assess the feasibility of using alternative sampling techniques in combination with molecular assays to detect endometrial and ovarian cancers. We will compare sampling using a Tampon and a sheathed endometrial brush, the Tao brush. We want to assess the quality of DNA extracted from the different samplers. We will assess the correlations between methylation of somatic DNA for a selected marker panel and cancer status. We wish to include 117 women age 45 years and older with suspected endometrial cancer or ovarian cancer, and 53 age-matched controls without malignancy, all of whom are referred to surgery at the Mayo clinic. We plan to conduct a pilot study of women with confirmed or suspected endometrial cancer or ovarian cancer, and women treated for benign conditions. DNA will be extracted from samples collected using a vaginal Tampon and an endometrial brushing using an FDA approved device (Tao brush) prior to surgery. A panel of methylation markers will be analyzed from samples yielding sufficient DNA. The results of the methylation analysis will be compared to the final histology for all patients in the study. We will set the detection of methylation at one or more loci in 50% of women in each arm as a technical success.]]></bodyfield>

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[This is a case-control study nested within a retrospective cohort of approximately 8,000 women diagnosed with endometrial hyperplasia from 1970-2002 at a pre-paid health plan. The goal of the study is to define risks of progression for histological categories of endometrial hyperplasia, the precursor of typical forms on endometrial carcinoma, and to validate candidate molecular pathological prognostic markers to assess risk of subsequent carcinoma. Cases included 138 women with pathology panel confirmed endometrial hyperplasia who progressed to carcinoma; controls consisted of 241 women with pathology confirmed endometrial hyperplasia matched on age, date of diagnosis and duration of follow-up and counter-matched on severity of hyperplasia. The study has shown that the risk of progression among women with atypical hyperplasia, the most severe form, is 8% through four years rising to 28% through 19 years of follow-up. The study has shown that non-atypical forms of endometrial hyperplasia are far less likely to progress than atypical hyperplasia. The study includes basic data related to patient characteristics and treatment and multiple tissues from initial and repeat biopsies. A tissue microarray has been prepared from the endometrial cancer tissues. Current activities are focusing on validating biomarkers in endometrial hyperplasia that predict risk of progression to cancer, including immunohistochemical stains and molecular assays.]]></bodyfield>

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[A large hospital-based case-control study of renal cancer carcinoma (RCC) led by the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, DCEG, was conducted in Central and Eastern Europe from 1999 to 2003. This study was a collaboration between the NCI and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The study included 925 cases of RCC and 1247 controls matched on age, gender, and study centers in Russia, Romania, Poland, and Czech Republic. The VHL-HIF (von Hippel Lindau-Hypoxia Inducible Factor) pathway has been implicated in the etiology of cancer, especially RCC. To date, the role of common genetic variants in genes in the VHL-HIF pathway has not been investigated in the susceptibility of kidney cancer in a large population. The objective of this project is to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or haplotypes in genes of the VHL-HIF pathway are associated with the susceptibility to kidney cancer in the general population.

We are collaborating with investigators at University of California at Berkeley and the California Department of Health Services on their ongoing population-based case-control study of childhood leukemia in the San Francisco Bay area and the agricultural Central Valley (35 counties). A substantial proportion of the population in this area is employed in agriculture or lives in close proximity to agricultural fields, making this an ideal study population to evaluate agricultural pesticide exposures and risk of childhood leukemia. Furthermore, a large proportion of the study population is Hispanic. No previous large-scale childhood leukemia studies have targeted Hispanics or agricultural populations. A major aim of our collaboration is to improve the exposure assessment of agricultural and home and garden pesticides by measuring pesticides in house dust samples. We are also measuring other chemical exposures including cotinine, PCBs, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In addition to evaluating specific chemical levels in dust and risk of childhood leukemia, we are conducting several methodological studies to evaluate factors associated with residential exposure to pesticides.]]></bodyfield>

Known risk factors include chronic infections with hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, excessive consumption of alcohol, certain rare metabolic disorders (e.g., hemochromatosis), diabetes and obesity. Whether these factors explain liver cancer in the U.S. has not been adequately examined. As a result, we are conducting a liver cancer pooling project among existing U.S. cohorts in order to explore liver cancer etiology in a prospective manner. Cohorts are contributing questionnaire data and serum samples to this effort. As liver cancer remains a rare disease, despite the increasing incidence, additional U.S. cohorts are being sought to participate in this investigation.]]></bodyfield>

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[EAGLE is a large population-based case-control study designed and conducted to investigate the genetic and environmental determinants of lung cancer and smoking persistence using an integrative approach that allows combined analysis of genetic, environmental, clinical, and behavioral data. The study includes over 2,000 incident lung cancer cases, both males and females of Italian nationality, ages 35 to 79 years old, with verified lung cancer of any histological type, and over 2,000 healthy population-based controls matched to cases by age, gender, and residence.

Over 500,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will be genotyped to identify genetic susceptibility to lung cancer risk and survival, and to smoking persistence in this project which was awarded funding by the National Human Genome Research Institute Genes, Environment and Health Initiative (GEI). After validation of a proportion of the significant SNPs in collaborative replication studies, further steps will include fine mapping of verified regions of interest, gene resequencing, and functional assays to provide biological clues for the findings. Analyses of smoking and other phenotypes across GEI-funded genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are planned.

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[Using extant data from PLCO, SEER Medicare, and a cohort study in China, IIB is mentoring an epidemiology PhD dissertation on three closely related analyses of the relationship of lung cancer to tuberculosis, pneumonia and radiographic evidence of pulmonary scarring. These are expected to be completed in FY07. In FY2007, IIB plans to conduct a pilot study, using prediagnostic sera from cases and controls in the ATBC cohort study. This would estimate the risk of lung cancer associated with antibodies against pertussis and against a panel of mycobacterial antigens, as well as with inflammation markers and antibodies against C. pneumoniae.

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[Endemic Burkitt lymphoma (BL) has been associated with EBV and Falciparum malaria infections, but the role of these agents is poorly understood. As background for a new, cost-effective approach to clarifying these associations through the use of extant specimens, in FY2006 the Branch completed development work on three fronts. First, we found that EBV viral load was extremely high in Ugandan children with sickle cell disease; whether EBV DNA can be detected and quantified in old sera remains to be proven. Second, we determined that DNA extracted from 30-year-old Ugandan sera from the West Nile cohort study of BL are suitable for genetic polymorphism analysis. Third, we are working with the NCI Core Genotyping Facility to develop Taqman assays to determine polymorphisms in six malaria-resistance genes. If the development work succeeds, in FY2007-2008 IIB will compare the risk of BL associated with hemoglobin S and five other malaria-resistance genetic polymorphisms in DNA extracted from pathology tissue of BL cases compared to tissue of BL-free controls, adjusted for data abstracted from medical records, in Uganda. Simultaneously, the same polymorphisms and perhaps EBV load will be assessed in extant sera from BL cases and matched controls.

Currently, we are collaborating on studies using the candidate gene approach to identify common genetic variants in relation to both NHL susceptibility and survival within the NCI-SEER NHL Study, focusing on key genes in cell cycle control, DNA repair, and immune function pathways that likely contribute to lymphomagenesis. We are also conducting molecular studies utilizing the paraffin-embedded tumor tissue collected for approximately 70% of the cases.

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[NHLs characteristically have oncogene-activating chromosomal translocations, such as the prototypic t14;18 of follicular lymphoma involving BCL2 and the CMYC activating translocation t8;14 in Burkitt lymphoma. Analyses with specimens from IIB's HIV-infected cohorts and collections from collaborators are planned. It is clear that these mutations are not sufficient to cause malignant transformation, since low level t14;18 is detectable in up to 50% of healthy individuals. IIB has proposed collaborations with several large population-based cohorts to determine whether the prevalence or level of t14;18 is associated with risk of NHL and to investigate the clonal relationship between translocation-bearing cells and subsequent tumors. If approved, this would be completed in FY2009.

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[A case-control study is being conducted in Italy to study the role of pigmentation and other host factors in the etiology of melanoma in a population with a wide range of pigmentary phenotypes and intense sun exposure. This is a collaborative study between the NCI, Bufalini Hospital, Cesena, and the University of L’Aquila, L’Aquila, Italy. The study includes over 350 melanoma cases and 350 healthy controls, matched by age, sex and residence. To address the genetic determinants of melanoma in the Mediterranean population through a different approach, a family study of melanoma is also currently ongoing in the same areas of Italy. To date, the study includes 76 families with 2 to 5 melanoma-affected individuals per family. Unaffected relatives from these families are also enrolled.

An additional project includes melanoma patients participating in either the Italian case/control or the Italian family study of melanoma who have agreed to donate multiple tissue biopsies from normal skin, common melanocytic nevi, dysplastic nevi and melanoma to allow the investigation of the pathways potentially involved in the transition from common nevi to melanoma.

Factors investigated included Epstein Barr Virus, diet, smoking, occupation, HLA, and other polymorphisms. Histologically confirmed incident cases of nasopharyngeal cancer and two controls groups (hospital and community) were recruited. Participants completed an in-depth, in-person risk factor questionnaire that obtained information on adult and childhood exposures. Mothers of cases and controls were also interviewed to obtain information on dietary patterns in early life. Blood, urine, and toe-nail specimens were collected from all participants to allow for molecular assessment of various environmental and genetic factors of interest, and biopsy tissue was obtained from all cases and hospital controls.

To identify mechanisms associated with altered gene expression in NPC tumors at chromosomal regions identified by linkage and expression profiling by screening NPC tumors for promoter methylation and copy number changes.
To narrow the region and/or number of genes on those regions potentially involved in NPC development.

Both groups of women have now been followed for five years to assess the impact of their choice on cancer occurrence and quality of life. The clinical phase of this study is complete, and efforts are now focused on addressing the specific endpoints that the study was designed to evaluate. Eligible GOG-199 study participants are now being invited to join an extension of the original study. Known as GOG-8199, it only requires filling out a short questionnaire once a year, after signing a new consent form. There have been 2 major publications to date from this project, plus a large number of publications related to our collaboration with the Consortium of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 ("CIMBA"), which aims to discover other genes which influence the likelihood that mutation carriers will develop breast or ovarian cancer.

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[This population-based case-control study of ovarian and endometrial cancer was conducted among female residents of Warsaw and Lodz (Poland) between 2001 and 2003. We identified all women with histologically-confirmed ovarian and endometrial carcinoma through a rapid ascertainment system in participating hospitals and cancer registries. The collection of biological specimens includes blood, urine, and paraffin embedded tumor tissue. Control women were randomly selected from complete population lists and were frequency matched to cases on age and study site. A personal interview and blood/mouthwash sample was collected. A total of 347 women with invasive ovarian cancer and 555 women with endometrial cancer were enrolled. We share 2,798 controls between breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer cases. We have recently constructed tissue microarrays including tumor samples from approximately 200 ovarian cancer cases and 300 endometrial cancer cases for immunohistochemical analyses. We are currently extracting nucleic acids from tissue cores to create a resource for DNA-based studies. The main research projects being conducted include: Analyses of questionnaire-based factors and anthropometric/physical activity measurements in relation to cancer risk and clinical outcomes; identifying genetic susceptibility markers of cancer risk and clinical outcomes using candidate gene and genome-wide association (GWAS) approaches; analyses of tissue/tumor markers to evaluate relationships with cancer risk factors (known or suspected), and their impact on predicting recurrence and survival after diagnosis; and analyses of biomarkers in DNA (somatic changes), cryopreserved blood cells, serum/plasma, and urine in relationship to cancer risk and clinical outcomes. Current projects include methylation profiling, tumor gene sequencing, microsatellite instability analysis, and immunohistochemistry to study the etiologic heterogeneity of endometrial and ovarian cancers.]]></bodyfield>

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[Disruption in circadian rhythms has recently been classified as probably carcinogenic to humans, although no underlying molecular mechanism has been identified. We are investigating the role of circadian rhythms in prostate cancer, using a multidisciplinary approach. On a genetic level, using data from the Shanghai Prostate Cancer Study, we first reported that variants of several core circadian genes were associated with prostate cancer risk. We are extending this finding to larger and more comprehensive validation studies, including PLCO (1,100 cases and 1,100 controls), the Agricultural Health Study (AHS; 776 cases and 1,444 controls), and the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT; 1,800 cases and 1,800 controls), as well as pooling existing data on variants in circadian genes from genome-wide association studies of advanced prostate cancer in the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3). On a serum biomarker level, we are investigating the role of serum melatonin, a nocturnal hormonal marker of circadian rhythms, in a large nested case-control study of prostate cancer in PLCO (800 cases and 800 controls). We are also investigating the relationship between sleep duration and prostate cancer risk in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, a cohort of a quarter of a million men with over 17,200 prostate cancer cases. Results from these studies will provide important insights into how circadian rhythms may influence prostate cancer risk. More information, Ann Hsing.]]></bodyfield>

While an inverse association is seen between diabetes and overall prostate cancer, divergent relationships are seen between obesity and high- and low-grade disease. To provide a better understanding of these complex relationships, we are conducting a pooled analysis within the Cohort Consortium (over 735,000 men, including over 43,000 prostate cancer cases) to determine the independent and joint effects of diabetes (including duration of diabetes) and obesity on aggressive prostate cancer risk. Since obesity, diabetes, and prostate cancer are common conditions with rising incidence rates in most populations, a better understanding of their relationships is critical and has considerable potential for cancer prevention and important public health implications.

West Africans and African-Americans share genetic ancestry but have very different lifestyles and environmental exposures. This study has two components: a clinical survey to estimate the incidence of clinical prostate cancer in Accra and a population screening survey to estimate the prevalence of prostate cancer in the male Accra population. The clinical component of the study includes the collection of clinical and pathological data for the more than 500 prostate cancer cases diagnosed over the last five years. The population component of the study seeks to screen 1,000 healthy men, using serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing and digital rectal examination, followed by biopsy confirmation as required. Interviews will be conducted to elicit information on demographics, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, body size, medical history, health care utilization, and urinary symptoms.

These results provided clinical evidence that intraprostatic androgen action is important in prostate cancer etiology. To validate and provide biological support for this hypothesis, we are conducting a large, nested case-control study in the PCPT (1,800 case-control pairs) to investigate if finasteride treatment alters serum levels of various androgens, including 3a-diol G (a distal metabolite of tissue DHT and a serum marker for intraprostatic DHT), and if the changes in serum androgen levels between pre- and post-finasteride treatment are associated with reductions in prostate cancer risk.

Within each of these three thematic research programs, we have developed studies of serum-based biomarkers (including cytokines and other inflammatory markers, metabolic markers associated with insulin resistance, melatonin as an endogenous indicator of circadian rhythms, and sarcosine, a metabolite recently found to be associated with aggressive prostate cancer), genetic susceptibility markers (such as genes involved in inflammation, insulin signaling, steroid hormone metabolism, and circadian rhythms), and questionnaire data (including existing conditions, such as diabetes, and anthropometric measurements, such as body mass index) in order to evaluate their roles in prostate carcinogenesis. The large sample size of the nested case-control study permits investigation of relatively small effects of biochemical markers and genetic determinants of prostate cancer. Use of the same study population for all studies also provides an opportunity to explore joint effects of the different risk factors on prostate cancer risk.

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[mong African American men, prostate cancer risk was reported to be increased with serologic evidence of prior syphilis, but other associations with sexually transmitted infections or activities have been inconsistent. In FY2006, the Branch completed and submitted for publication a case-control study in which prostate cancer was not associated with KSHV seropositivity in either African or European American men. Contemporaneously, in FY2005, the Branch received approval to test prediagnostic sera from 1100 prostate cancer cases and matched controls in the PLCO cohort with a panel of well validated serologic markers of six sexually transmitted infections. Testing and analysis are expected to be completed in FY2006 and FY2007, respectively.

A previously unknown retrovirus, conditionally named xenotropic murine-related retrovirus (XMRV), was detected in the stromal tissue adjacent to prostate cancers from several men with the homozygous QQ variant of the RNASEL gene, which plays a critical role in innate immunity. IIB has proposed to modify the study of sexually transmitted infections by seeking to detect antibodies against two XMRV antigens in RNASEL homozygous QQ and RR (the common allele) prostate cancer cases and matched controls in the PLCO cohort. This would be completed in FY2007. Subsequent work would depend on the results. ]]></bodyfield>

The study included 237 cancer cases, 206 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, and 471 healthy controls randomly selected from the population. Results to date suggest that higher levels of education, a high waist-to-hip ratio (an indicator of central obesity), and a higher intake of total calories, red meat, and animal fat and protein are associated with an increased risk, while higher consumption of allium vegetables, peppers, and mushrooms is associated with reduced risk. In addition, a shorter repeat length of CAG in the androgen receptor gene and higher serum levels of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF- 1) are associated with an increased risk. Several genetic polymorphisms found revealed no association with disease. Other genetic, hormonal, and micronutrient factors are also being examined using serum and genomic DNA extracted from buffy coat samples. More information, Ann Hsing.]]></bodyfield>

Age standardized ESCC incidence rates of 109/100,000 in men and 175/100,000 in women were reported from this area in the 1970s, and no studies have been performed since that time. Atrak Clinic, a referral clinic for upper gastrointestinal diseases, was recently established in Golestan Province by physicians from the Digestive Diseases Research Center of Tehran University of Medical Sciences, and this Clinic serves as the field center for this study. All patients referred to the Clinic routinely undergo upper endoscopy and biopsy for evaluation and diagnosis. Patients who have histologically confirmed ESCC and consent to join the study have been enrolled as cases. Two control groups have also been enrolled in this study, one selected from the neighborhoods of case subjects (primary controls) and one from the patients referred to Atrak Clinic who do not have cancer (secondary controls). Both the cases and the controls were interviewed and underwent collection of biological specimens including blood, hair and nails. After a 3 1/2 year accrual period (2003-2007) 300 cases, 571 neighborhood controls and 300 Atrak Clinic controls were successfuly enrolled and are currently being analyzed. Environmental risk factors (including life-style, habits, and nutritional status) are being assessed through questionnaires and objective measurements in biological specimens. The role of genetic polymorphisms is also being studied using genomic DNA from cases and controls. Biopsy samples collected from cases and clinic controls are also being used to evaluate the association of esophageal PAH exposure and case status.]]></bodyfield>

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[The risk of non-cardia gastric cancer is relatively low in Africa although H. pylori infection is highly prevalent, occurs at a young age and persists throughout life. Using residual serum samples from rural Tanzania, in FY2006 we started investigating the hypothesis that populations where gastric cancer incidence is low despite high H. pylori prevalence are characterized by Th2-dominant immune responses. We are determining Th1/Th2 using novel IgG1/IgG2 H. pylori-specific subclass antibodies. This analysis will be completed in FY2007. To further test the pro-inflammatory hypothesis, in FY2007-2008 we plan to obtain residual serum samples for Th1/Th2 responses (IgG1/IgG2 H. pylori-specific subclass antibodies) from subjects with and without esophageal and gastric dysplasia in rural Kenya, where gastric cancer and esophageal cancers are more common.]]></bodyfield>

With the conclusion of the intervention phase in 1991, and the determination that the micronutrient combination of selenium/vitamin E/ß-carotene reduced total mortality, total cancer mortality, and gastric cancer mortality, objectives now include:

Determination of post-trial effects of the interventions;
Evaluation of etiologic hypotheses, including nutrition, carcinogens, infections, genetics, and other exposures;
Studies of natural history; and Examination of interactions (gene-environment, gene-gene, and gene-intervention).
In collaboration with the Cancer Institute of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences in Beijing, we continue to follow trial participants to ascertain endpoints, conduct nested case-control and case-cohort studies using baseline serum, and perform expanded DNA and biochemical analyses on additional blood samples collected during follow-up.

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[Testicular cancer is the most common form of cancer in young men ages 15 to 35. It accounts for about 1 percent of all cancer in men, with approximately 7,400 cases diagnosed in the United States every year. It is much more common in white males than in black males. Our current research is focused on evaluating the role of testicular microlithiasis in familial testicular cancer and pursuing genetic research using previously-collected biological samples.

International Testicular Cancer Linkage Consortium ("ITCLC"), a scientific collaboration dedicated to mapping and cloning the genes related to testicular cancer susceptibility in humans. There are three components to our collaboration with the ITCLC: 1. We are contributing DNA from newly-ascertained US testicular cancer families to this international gene identification effort. 2. We are capitalizing on the large set of European families which has already been assembled by the ITCLC by taking the scientific lead in designing and conducting two additional studies: (a) a centralized review of the pathology of a large series of familial testicular cancers and a comparison group of non-familial testicular cancers. (b) a formal, quantitative analysis of the occurrence of cancers other than testicular cancer in these families. 3. We have published a descriptive analysis of the ITCLC testicular cancer family set (n=500), the largest collection of multiple-case families extant. The goal of this project was to identify etiologically homogenous subsets of families which might be more amenable to linkage-based gene discovery. In general, the risk factor profile of familial TGCT cases was surprisingly similar to that of sporadic TGCT. 4. Data from the 5 major ITCLC contributors demonstrated convincingly, for the first time, that age-at-diagnosis of familial TGCT is significantly younger than its sproadic counterpart. 5. The final two analyses from this collaboration - (a) quantification of the risk of cancers other than TGCT in multiple-case families, and (b) detailed comparison of the histology of familial versus sporadic TGCT - are underway, with final publications expected within the next 6 months.

To better understand the molecular epidemiology of testicular cancer, the National Cancer Institute and the Department of Defense are conducting a case-control study of testicular cancer among military servicemen. The project includes obtaining biosamples and questionnaire data from all participants.

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[The heritability of TGCT is high, with studies suggesting TGCT risks of eight-fold in brothers and four-fold in fathers of affected men, compared to men in the general population. However, genome-wide association studies of single-nucleotide polymorphisms have found limited heritable risk. In addition to TGCT being a complex genetic disease, with many alleles contributing small changes in risk, heritable risk could also manifest itself in DNA methylation which can affect gene expression. Recent studies examining genes involved in tumor suppression or cell-cycling have suggested there may be differences in methylation patterns between normal and TGCT tissue. At the National Cancer Institute, we have the opportunity to use a high-throughput assay to assess methylation across 800 genes. This study will compare the methylation profiles of specific TGCT histologies, such as seminoma, embryonal carcinoma and teratoma, with one another and with adjacent ‘normal’ tissue. This agnostic and powerful approach may provide clues into the etiology of TGCTs.]]></bodyfield>

We are currently conducting a small pilot study of a viral chip which tests for the presence of 655 human viruses. We have extracted RNA from 24 Caucasian TGCT specimens, all of which were snap-frozen from fresh. The results from this pilot may be extended into a larger study.]]></bodyfield>

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[In almost all countries with more than one racial/ethnic group, men of European descent are at higher risk of TGCT than are men of non-European descent, particularly men of African descent. Men of European ancestry in the U.S. have incidence rates of TGCT that are approximately seven times higher than incidence rates among African-American men. Whether the disparity is due to variability of environmental exposures or genetic differences, or a combination of the two, is not clear. However, the varying risks of different racial/ethnic groups living in one country suggest that genetic susceptibility may play a role. To better understand racial/ethnic variability in rates, we are conducting a genetic admixture study among African-American TGCT patients. As TGCT is much more prevalent in European-derived than in African-derived populations, the admixture approach can identify regions of unexpectedly high European-ancestry in African-American men with TGCT. These peaks of European chromosomal ancestry would identify underlying TGCT risk loci, because of underlying linkage disequilibrium between the ancestry informative SNP and any TGCT-causing genetic variant(s) with large differences in allele frequencies between the ancentral populations. To conduct this genetic admixture study, we are collaborating with a number of investigators at institutions across the U.S. Collaborators are contributing formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded pathology blocks from which DNA is being obtained.]]></bodyfield>

A causal relationship is plausible, because C. pneumonia can cause chronic lung infection and inflammation, which might increase cancer risk. In FY2007, IIB approved, nested case-control study within the NCI's PLCO cancer screening trial will evaluate whether serologic evidence of chronic C. pneumonia infection is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. Markers of lung inflammation and an extensive panel of polymorphisms in genes related to innate immunity will also be evaluated. These polymorphism analyses will complement a nearly completed IIB-led analysis of candidate susceptibility genes in a lung cancer case-control study.

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[Nitrates - Contamination of drinking water with nitrates is a growing problem in many agricultural areas of the country. A Branch study in Nebraska noted an association between measured nitrate levels in community-supplies drinking water and an increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Residential histories from a case-control study of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in Iowa is being linked with data on nitrate levels in community water systems to further evaluate this finding. Further studies in Iowa are evaluating community-supplied drinking water nitrate levels and cancers of the bladder, brain, colon, rectum, pancreas, and kidney. The population using private wells can have considerably higher exposure to nitrate because private wells are not regulated and they are often located in agricultural areas. Using a geographic information system-based model that incorporates land use, soil characteristics, irrigation practices, and other factors, we are estimating private well nitrate levels for census block groups in the Platte River Valley of Nebraska. The combined public and private supply nitrate estimates will be used in an ecologic study to evaluate drinking water nitrate and cancer incidence patterns.

Chlorination byproducts - Chlorine interacts with organic materials in water to form a mixture of chlorinated chemical byproducts. Although concentrations are quite low, there is concern that some chemicals in the mixture may increase cancer risk. A Branch study of six cancer sites conducted in Iowa found associations of rectal and bladder cancers with long-term (> 40 years) exposure to drinking water high in these unintentional byproducts. The data from additional cancer sites included in the study are under evaluation.

Arsenic - Arsenic in drinking water causes skin cancer, and a growing body of evidence suggests internal cancers, especially cancer of the bladder. A recent study in Utah suggested that the elevated bladder cancer risk of men who had smoked was increased even more by long-term consumption of arsenic in drinking water. We are following up on this observation in a collaboration with Utah researchers who collected information from bladder cancer patients and controls in the early 1980s. A case-control study of bladder cancer in New England is underway to determine if arsenic in drinking water might contribute to persistently high rates of this cancer in that region.]]></bodyfield>

The association with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma suggests the possibility of a mechanism involving the immune system.

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[The HIV/AIDS Cancer Match, U.S. study is designed to examine cancer risk in people living with HIV infection. The study utilizes data collected by state and regional HIV/AIDS and cancer registries throughout the United States. The National Cancer Institute uses these study data to determine the spectrum of cancers that occur in HIV-infected people. The risk of cancer in HIV-infected people is compared with that in the general population to determine which cancers arise more frequently than expected. Investigators compare different groups of HIV-infected people, to determine whether certain individuals are at especially high risk of cancer. Through frequent updates of the data, investigators also monitor changing trends in cancer risk over time.
People who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or who have the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have an elevated risk for some cancers. This high risk occurs because HIV weakens the immune system, and because many other cancer risk factors are common in HIV-infected people. By studying the patterns of cancer risk among HIV-infected people, NCI investigators seek to better understand how the immune system protects people from developing cancer. Another goal of the study is to look for trends in cancer risk in the HIV populations and identify important opportunities for cancer prevention.

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[KSHV infection is common in Africa, but its distribution varies widely. Based partially on completed IIB projects in Uganda and Egypt, we postulate that KSHV distribution is modulated, in part, by environmental factors, such as parasitic infections that modify the risk of acquisition or transmission. KSHV seroprevalence and KS risk are high in Uganda, but as elsewhere their distribution is heterogeneous. The Branch has received preliminary approval to test blood samples from the Uganda National HIV Sero-Behavioral Survey (UHSBS; 2004/2005) to investigate environmental (parasitic infections, source of drinking water, highland vs. lowland) and socioeconomic factors (urban vs. rural, education, income, occupation) postulated to be associated with KSHV seropositivity and with KSHV DNA detection and level in blood cells. Additional analyses are planned to uncover associations of KSHV seropositivity with previously collected questionnaire data on sexual activity and diseases (HIV, syphilis, and HSV2 serology) among adults in this predominantly heterosexual population. Using data from the cancer registry in Uganda, we plan to estimate the risk of KS given KSHV seropositivity, as we did previously for the Mediterranean region.

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[There is substantial variation in the annual mean concentration of radon in the same North American homes measured several years apart. These findings call into question the assumption that year-long indoor air radon measurements offer a valid estimate of cumulative radon exposures in homes over a period of 15-20 years, the most biologically meaningful exposure period. All previous studies used detectors that measure current radon in air. In our new case-control study, we carried out both standard year-long air measurements and CR-39 alpha detectors measurements (call surface monitors) which directly measure long-term (20- year and more) cumulative exposure using glass objects in the home. The surface monitors take advantage of the fact that the first long-lived radon progeny, 210-lead (half-life 22 yrs), becomes embedded in glass surfaces in homes. The alpha activity of 210-polonium, a decay product of 210-lead, is measured in glass objects in the home and serves as a long-term retrospective exposure-meter for residential radon. This population-based case-control study of lung cancer was specifically designed to compliment our earlier study by evaluating the effect of cumulative residential radon exposure among Missouri women who were predominantly smokers and former smokers using a control selection technique that minimized the inherent imbalance in smoking frequency between cases and controls.]]></bodyfield>

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[HPV is not only the cause of cervical cancer, but is increasingly recognized as an important cause of some oropharyngeal, vulvar, and anal cancers(1). Given the many similarities between HPV-related cancers at the cervix and other anatomic sites, researchers are optimistic that the HPV vaccine will protect against extra-cervical infections with high vaccine efficacy. In fact, the vaccine shown to confer near complete protection against cervical, vulvar and vaginal precancers associated with HPV16 or 18. To determine whether the HPV16/18 prophylactic vaccine protects against HPV16/18 infections in the oral, vulvar, and anal regions, we propose to collect oral, vulvar, and anal specimens from women in the NCI-sponsored Costa Rican community-based randomized phase III clinical trial and to test these specimens for presence of HPV DNA. The main aim of this proof of principle study is to determine the impact of HPV vaccination in preventing infections at all of these mucosal epithelial surfaces among the ~7500 women in the on-going trial.

One, using Jamaican specimens, would examine the possibility that chimerism accounts for breast feeding transmission of HTLV-I.

A detailed questionnaire on smoking behaviors and other lung cancer risk factors will be administered to all ~1600 subjects. In addition, the investigators will measure serum cotinine (a marker of recent smoking intensity) for a sample of 340 African American males from the cohort, stratified on the amount of cigarette use, HIV status, and CD4 count. Spirometry will be performed on the entire group of 1600 subjects, to assess for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Differences between HIV-infected and uninfected subjects in smoking habits, exposure to tobacco, or lung damage will identify areas for future investigation. ]]></bodyfield>

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[We are carrying out a multi-racial methodologic study in the U.S. and China to investigate whether serum levels of hormones reflect intraprostatic androgenicity. A total of 600 subjects, including African Americans, Caucasians, Asian Americans, and Chinese men living in China, diagnosed with prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, or bladder cancer undergoing prostatectomy will be recruited for tissue and blood collection. Hormone levels in prostatic tissue will be measured and compared with serum levels and polymorphisms of hormone-related genes. Levels of androgen receptor and its associated proteins in prostate tissue will be measured directly. In addition, factors such as age, smoking, and body size that might alter serum-tissue correlations will be examined. Possible racial variation in the serum-tissue correlations will also be assessed. This study is the first of its kind to investigate androgenicity in target tissue directly and will help guide future epidemiologic studies on prostate cancer. More information, Ann Hsing.]]></bodyfield>

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[Chronic inflammation from infection is related to cancer risk, as demonstrated by H. pylori with gastric cancer and periodontal hygiene with oral and esophageal cancers. There are hundreds and perhaps thousands of currently unidentified, mostly anaerobic bacterial species in the lumen or attached to the epithelium of the colon. New technologies, based on 16s rRNA sequence relationships, can categorize and obtain the relative quantity of all species, known and unknown. IIB is organizing a DCEG working group and in FY2007 will initiate collaborations with genomists and statisticians to assess oligonucleotide-based chip and other technologies. Two or more technologies will be pursued, starting with pilot studies in FY2008 to assess sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility with various types and conditions of specimens. When deemed satisfactory, probably in FY2008-2009, previously collected specimens from colon and oro-pharyngeal cancer case-control studies will be examined. If these results are promising, in FY2009-2010 collaborations with others holding suitable specimens and data will be established to characterize the relationships of alimentary tract, urinary, and potentially other cancers to the full spectrum of microbial flora.]]></bodyfield>

Identifying clonal abnormalities in tumors would confirm its malignant nature and clarify its pathogenesis. To determine genomic integrity (loss or gain of gene regions) and clonality of KS, in FY2007 we plan to complete analyses using digital comparative genomic hybridization and other clonal markers to compare multiple tumors with each other and with normal skin from 80 Ugandan subjects with AIDS-related and endemic KS. To investigate the possibility of donor transmission of KS cells, which would corroborate a study of Italian transplant recipients, in FY2007 we expect to receive KS tumor specimens from African transplant recipients. Analyses of these will be completed by FY2008.

To better understand the etiology of cancer in this population,  investigators are  conducting the Transplant Cancer Match Study (http://transplantmatch.cancer.gov/). This study is a collaborative effort with the Health Resources and Services Administration, which oversees the U.S. solid organ transplant network. Data from multiple state and regional cancer registries are linked with the U.S. registry of transplant recipients, to cover approximately 40% of the U.S. transplant population.. Goals of the project include: 1) description of the spectrum of cancer risk in solid organ transplant recipients; 2) elucidation of the role of oncogenic viruses in causing cancer in this setting; and 3) understanding the role of other factors in causing cancer, such as demographic factors, mismatch between donor and recipient, and specific immunosuppressive medication.]]></bodyfield>

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[The HPV Vaccine Trial in Costa Rica is a collaboration between investigators in Costa Rica and the National Cancer Institute. The trial is designed as a blinded, randomized, phase III clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of a bivalent HPV-16/18 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine. The vaccine used in the trial was developed by investigators at NCI and other research institutions and is manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals. The trial was initiated on June 28, 2004 and enrollment was completed on December 22, 2005; there were 7466 women enrolled.

Trial staff will follow all enrolled women for a period of four years. Women who are eligible, consent, and are randomized into the trial receive three doses of the HPV-16/18 VLP or Havrix (Hepatitis A) vaccine over a period of six months. At entry and throughout follow-up, women are carefully monitored and receive state-of-the-art screening for cervical neoplasia.

This study was designed to evaluate vaccine efficacy, immunological correlates of long-term vaccine success and failure, and other factors of immunological and etiological interest. Active follow-up of participants and the extensive data and biological specimen collection components of the study will permit such evaluations. More information, Allan Hildesheim ]]></bodyfield>

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[Most Genetic Epidemiology Branch investigations evaluate the contributions of host susceptibility and environmental exposure in the development of cancer. In family studies, the host susceptibility measure is frequently an alteration in specific gene(s). These studies tend to be very long term with varying activity. Although two genes associated with melanoma susceptibility have been identified (CDKN2A and CDK4), alterations in these genes are found in only a small percentage of melanoma-prone families. The search for other genes continues; in collaboration with an international consortium (GenoMEL), a search for a new melanoma susceptibility genes continues both within families and a genome-wide association study. In a methodologic study, we compared CDKN2A mutation detection using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography to usual screening acorss nine different centers in GenoMEL. We found that mutation detection across the groups was consistent and of high quality. We continue to accrue and evaluate new families. We have also conducted an association study of familial melanoma using a candidate gene approach. THe analysis is continuing. We have continued to evaluate families of individuals with heritable retinoblastoma and melanoma.

Following a congressional mandate, a retrospective cohort study was undertaken in collaboration with 18 plastic surgery practices. Assembled for study were 13,500 women having undergone augmentation mammoplasty at these practices prior to 1989 and 4,000 comparison patients (women receiving other types of plastic surgery).

In 1992, over 25,000 postmenopausal women volunteered for FIT, a clinical trial to determine whether the drug alendronate could reduce the incidence of osteoporosis fractures. The BFIT study is a retrospective cohort study which will use data from FIT to evaluate how bone mineral density of the hip is related to subsequent cancer risk. National Cancer Institute and FIT investigators contacted FIT volunteers to identify incident cancers, and to evaluate whether risk factor information collected in 1992, such as measured bone mineral density, lifestyle factors, and certain growth factors, predicts subsequent cancer risk. Collection of additional risk factor information during this follow-up, including updated lifestyle factors and a buccal cell sample for genetic analyses, is allowing investigators to further explore the complex relationships between bone mass and other risk factors for breast, endometrial, and other cancers. Currently underway are efforts to understand interrelationships between bone mass and endogenous hormones and risk of these cancers.]]></bodyfield>

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[Infertility has long been recognized as a risk factor for various cancers, including breast and gynecologic cancers. More recently, concern has been raised regarding effects of drugs used to treat infertility, particularly since these drugs stimulate ovulation and raise endogenous estrogen levels. We assembled a retrospective cohort study in collaboration with four large reproductive endocrinology practices where women have been evaluated and/or treated for infertility. Included were 12,193 women seen at these practices prior to 1989. Detailed information was abstracted from medical records, and located patients were administered questionnaires to obtain updated information (through 1998) regarding disease risk factors and health status. Linkages were also performed with eight cancer registries and the National Death Index. Results regarding effects of ovulation-stimulating drugs on ovarian and breast cancer were largely reassuring, although there were slight but non-significant increases in risk among the women followed for the longest periods of time. Nearly two-fold increases in risk of uterine cancers were seen among women treated for long periods of time with clomiphene, of interest given that this is a selective estrogen receptor modulator with chemical properties similar to tamoxifen, another drug extensively linked with this cancer. In our previous follow-up, the cohort was relatively young. We have therefore recently initiated another round of follow-up, which will provide another 10 years of follow-up and considerably greater power to evaluate effects not only for the cancers previously evaluated but also for other cancers that might be affected by hormonal exposures (e.g., melanoma and thyroid cancers).]]></bodyfield>

One of the special features of the research conducted by investigators in the Genetic Epidemiology Branch is that it is carried out by a dedicated study team. Each member of the team brings special expertise to the study.

The Study Team for GEB’s chordoma research consists of the following individuals:

Alisa M. Goldstein, Ph.D. is a board certified Ph.D. medical geneticist. She has been involved in research to identify genes and environmental factors that increase a person's risk for develping cancer for over 20 years. She is the Principal Investigator of the Non-Familial Chordoma Study and serves as the senior consultant on laboratory and analytic aspects of both the Familial Chordoma Study and the Non-Familial Chordoma Study.

Dilys M. Parry, Ph.D. is a board certified Ph.D. medical geneticist. She has been involved in research on familial and hereditary cancers for 30 years. She began studying chordoma families in 1996 and then initiated the Familial Chordoma study. She is responsible for obtaining and analyzing the clinical information from both the Familial Chordoma Study and the Non-Familial Chordoma Study.

Deborah Zametkin, R.N., M.S.N. is a senior research nurse who has been working with patients with familial and hereditary cancers for 18 years. She has been involved in the Familial Chordoma Study since 1996 and now serves as the study manager for the Non-Familial Chordoma Study.

Rose Yang, Ph.D. is a tenure-track investigator who is interested in identifying genes and environmental factors that increase a person’s risk for developing cancer. She is responsible for deciding which laboratory studies should be done on DNA from members of chordoma families and from individuals who are the only person in their family with chordoma. She serves as the liaison between any laboratories involved in the chordoma research and the study team. She is also responsible for analyzing the laboratory data from the chordoma studies.

The study team collaborates with investigators from other institutions who are also studying chordoma or who have expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of chordoma or in state-of-the-art laboratory methods that can be used to examine biological specimens from members of chordoma families or from individuals who are the only person in their family with chordoma.

What Does Participation in the Familial Chordoma Study Involve?
Those who choose to participate in the Familial Chordoma Study will be asked to: 

Provide a blood sample or saliva as a source of DNA for genetic studies on chordoma or related cancers
Provide personal medical and family history information; and,
Give us permission to obtain past medical records about chordoma, other cancers and related illnesses, and a small piece of chordoma or any other cancer that was stored after surgery. 

Blood for the research can be drawn by a participant’s own physician or at a local laboratory and mailed to us. The other activities can be carried out in a participant’s home.

In addition, individuals from some chordoma families may be invited to the Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), in Bethesda, MD, to participate in clinical studies. These studies include having a physical examination and donating blood for research; they may also include undergoing magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies of the base of the skull and entire spine. Results of the clinical studies will be discussed with the participants before they return home and given to them to share with their primary doctors. 

Participants and family members will be able to ask questions and stay in touch with the research team. Participants will be asked to complete a yearly follow-up form to update medical information. We will provide participants with the overall findings of the study when analysis of information from the study is completed.

This study has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the NCI. NCI is required by Federal law not to reveal any personal information that is collected from study participants to anyone other than persons directly involved with the study. A system is in place to ensure your privacy; in addition, all information obtained as part of this research is protected from disclosure by a Certificate of Confidentiality issued by the NCI.

Costs. NCI will pay for all clinical studies done at the NIH Clinical Center and for travel to and from Bethesda, MD, for participants.

Treatment. Treatment is not offered as part of this study. However, if the need arises, we will discuss treatment options with participants. We will also provide assistance in establishing care with appropriate physicians as needed. Study participants will remain under the care of their primary doctors while participating in the study.

Who is Eligible to Participate in the Familial Chordoma Study?
To participate in the Familial Chordoma study, a family must have the following:

Two or more blood relatives with a history of chordoma
Family members who are eligible to participate include those with chordoma, and their parents, siblings and children. We may also invite other blood relatives to join the study if they are genetically linked to family members with chordoma.

In addition, if children who have a parent with chordoma participate, we may invite their unaffected parent to join the study. 

How to Contact Us about the Familial Chordoma Study
If your family has two or more blood relatives who have been diagnosed with chordoma and you and other family members are interested in contributing to research on familial chordoma, please complete and submit the Familial Chordoma study form . A research nurse will get back to you in a few days.

This information is not on a secure server, so if you prefer, you can call toll-free 1-800-518-8474 and ask to speak with Ms. Stephanie Steinbart about the Familial Chordoma Study. She is a research nurse who can answer your questions and provide additional information about this study.

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[What Does Participation in the Non-Familial Chordoma Study Involve?
Those who choose to participate in the Non-Familial Chordoma Study will be asked to:


Provide a saliva sample as a source of DNA for genetic studies on chordoma or related cancers;
Provide personal medical and family history information by completing a self-administered questionnaire; and
Give us permission to obtain past medical records about chordoma, and a small piece of chordoma that was stored after surgery.

People will be able to participate in this study from their homes. After they have contacted us to ask about this study, if they are interested in learning more about it, we will send them a letter that describes the study in more detail. We will then telephone them to determine whether they wish to participate in the research. If they decide to participate, we will mail a package to their home that contains all of the materials needed for the study. The package includes the study consent form, the personal and family medical history questionnaire, and the kit that contains a special plastic cup and a lid for using to collect a saliva sample. After they have signed the consent form, completed the questionnaire and collected the saliva sample, they can mail these back to us in a pre-addressed postage-paid envelope included in the package. 

We will provide participants with the overall findings of the study when analysis of information from the study is completed.

Based on information we learn about a participant’s personal or family medical history or from the laboratory tests done on DNA from the saliva or chordoma samples, we may re-contact a participant and invite him/her, and possibly some close relatives, to participate in a separate clinical study related to the development of chordoma. If we re-contact people about the clinical study, they can decide at that time whether they want to participate in it.

This study has been reviewed and approved by the Special Studies Institutional Review Board (SSIRB) of the NCI. NCI is required by Federal law not to reveal any personal information that is collected from study participants to anyone other than persons directly involved with the study. A system is in place to ensure the privacy of all participants; in addition, all information obtained as part of this research is protected from disclosure by a Certificate of Confidentiality issued by the NCI.

Who is Eligible to Participate in the Non-Familial Chordoma Study?
To participate in the Non-Familial Chordoma study, a person must be:


the only individual in his/her extended family diagnosed with chordoma, and
at least 6 years old.
If the individuals with chordoma are between the ages of 6 and 17 years of age, a parent can serve as a proxy for them and complete the personal and family medical history questionnaire. A parent may also help them collect the saliva sample. 

How to Contact Us about the Non-Familial Chordoma Study
If only one person in your family has ever been diagnosed with chordoma and you are interested in contributing to research on non-familial chordoma, please complete and submit the Non-Familial Chordoma study form . A research nurse will get back to you in a few days.

    <bodyfield><![CDATA[Page subtitle: Questionnaires and questionnaire segments for use in a variety of epidemiological studies.  

DCEG makes a variety of resources available for use in developing study questionnaires. Several questionnaires have been reviewed by DCEG’s Technical Evaluation Committee (TEQ) and approved as representing reasonably clear questions that address the standard exposures of interest in the topic category.

Available reviewed questionnaires, downloadable as Word documents 
• Smoking 
       o Active [link to page]
       o Passive [link to page]
• Alcohol use [link to page]
• Hormonal and reproductive factors [link to page]
• Socio-economic status (SES)[link to page]

About the questionnaires [disclaimer link]:

[The questionnaires share the following characteristics. They are:  

• Designed to address covariates (confounding) exposures, not main variables or the principal subject of a study, which might require more detailed questions
• Developed primarily for use in cohort studies, rather than case-control studies, which often require more questions about lifetime and historic, rather than current, exposures
• Predicated on English-speaking literate adult respondents, not special populations
• Designed to be self-explanatory, assuming that the questionnaire will be self-administered, not by interview.

In questionnaire development, there is often a choice between open-ended and categorical questions.  We included open-ended questions only when responses were likely to be both easily remembered by the participant and straightforward to analyze.] 

Additional questions for further development

We also offer groups of questions that have been used as part of DCEG or other epidemiologic studies, but have not necessarily been reviewed or analyzed by the TEQ committee.  These questions cover a variety of topics.  Please view them as starting points that can be adapted or improved upon as appropriate.
